## How to use
1. Ensure Expo is installed by following the official [Expo installation instructions](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)
2. Install packages with `yarn install`
3. Run project with `npx expo start`
4. Choose either an iOS simulator (android not yet supported) or run via the expo app
